Before it is really important to have docker on your computer, so please if you don't have it installed yet, do so. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

To use this, just clone the repo and use the follow command if you use windows
```bash
  cd BasicEmail
```

Now you are on the root of the repo, and you can use docker compose to use the Email.

It's done, you can use it!!.
